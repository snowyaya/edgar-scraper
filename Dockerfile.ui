# React (Vite) build → Nginx static server
# =============================================================================
#
# Build stages:
#   1. build  — Node.js builds the React SPA (output: /app/dist)
#   2. final  — Nginx serves the built assets, reverse-proxies /api → api:8000
#
# All /api/* requests are proxied to the FastAPI service.
# The browser only ever talks to one origin (port 80), avoiding CORS issues.

# --- Stage 1: Build ---
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for layer caching
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --quiet

# Copy source and build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
# Output is in /app/dist

# --- Stage 2: Serve ---
FROM nginx:1.27-alpine AS final

# Remove default nginx config
RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Copy our custom nginx config
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Copy built React app from build stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Run as non-root (nginx worker processes still run as nginx user)
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
